# Euklidischer Algorithmus

This project implements the Euclidean Algorithm in Rust. The Euclidean Algorithm is a classic method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. It is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference.

## Features

- Compute the GCD of two integers using the Euclidean Algorithm.
- Simple and efficient implementation in Rust.
- Example usage and explanation included.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/felstauren/euklidischer_algorithmus.git
    ```
2. Build and run the project:
    ```
    cargo run
    ```

## Example

Suppose you want to compute the GCD of 48 and 18:
